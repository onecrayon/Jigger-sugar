Ideas:
	- Add support for RGB(A) and HSL(A) CSS color notation
	- Add support for non-USD currency formatting (both input and output)
	- Language-specific support for color notation? Might make sense through ContextualSettings, if there's any interest
	- Support modifying file paths using standard "open" type dialog? (Probably would need to be a separate action; shoe-horning it into the existing sheet makes little sense, desire for a single shortcut notwithstanding)
